# Personal Homepage

Personal homepage written in HTML/CSS for use in any browser as the homepage and new tab page. It contains convenient links to personal and professional interests including:

- Daily Activities
- Technical Research
- Home Automation

## Daily Activities

Checking email, surfing reddit, watching YouTube - the normal daily routines one goes through. This is static and all links and services will be represented by custom iconography rather than written words. The site will be fully ADA compliant however, regardless of this project's chance of seeing public eye.

## Technical Research

Websites, forums, user guides, and relevant material to whatever I am working on or wanting to learn. This will be primarily text based and broken down by sections: Study Now, Projects, Future Projects. 

The Study Now section will include personal and professional tasks and projects and doesn't necessarily refer to the pursuit of formal education or certification (though this space could be used for that as well depending on your use case.) This section will rotate frequently.

Projects and Future Projects are self explanatory. Future Projects will be more of a long term link storage for various projects, including programming, tinkering with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, and projects unrelated to tech (i.e. home improvement, vacation). Projects will include links to sites pertinent to active personal and professional development and will see a rotation of items in the list.

## Home Automation

Network and other infrastructure as well as the smart home aspect. Primarily links to their local management web interfaces and control surfaces.

## To Do:

1. Locally hosted? Most browswer won't point locally without some tinkering
2. NAS - secure, backed up, locally accessible on the network via a very useful address that ***can*** be configured in most browsers.
3. Consider controlling the page via keyboard only, useful for those individuals, PC, Linux, and Mac alike, that prefer to control their systems by keyboard alone
4. Design and implement my own iconography for the home row, most used links and services
5. For those areas of the page that include content that will change frequently, consider a method of inserting changes rather than interfacing with the HTML page itself.
